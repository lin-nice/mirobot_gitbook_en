# <center>Introduction of WLKATA Mirobot</center>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;WLKATA Mirobot is a six-axis mini industrial robot arm manipulator and is independently developed and launched by Beijing Tsinew Technologies Co., Ltd. The WLKATA Mirobot manipulator is primarily developed for STEAM makers, and adolescent education and higher education purpose.<br/>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;It represents a new generation of lightweight six-axis desktop robot arm model, which integrates a variety of practical functions, such as drawing, handling, stacking, painting, writing and machine vision. Users can easily control Mirobot by remote controller, graphical programming, teaching and play. It has a rich I / O extension interface, which allowed it to connect to diverse end-effectors. For advanced operation, users could adopt Python, C++ and more for subsequent development. <br/>

##1. Structure of WLKATA Mirobot  
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;WLKATA Mirobot is mainly composed by a base, six rotating joints, a lower arm, an upper arm, an end-effector connection plate.
